## unique_ptr
- exclusive resource ownership
- usually same size as pointer and same operation speed
- can have custom deleters
	- 2nd argument to constructor
	- deleter part of pointer type
		- use decltype to get type
	- can increase unique_ptr size
		- stateless function objects like lambdas with no capture don't change size
		- functions increase size by at least function pointer size
- converts implictly to shared_ptr
