## emplace
- alternative to insert/push_back/push_front
	- takes constructor arguments rather than constructed object
	- perfect forwards and constructs in place
	- most of the time more efficient (see following conditions)
		- added value is constructed rather than assigned into the conatiner
			- emplace_back will always construct
			- emplace anywhere other than back will usually assign
				- creates temporary to assign from
				- no more efficient than insert
			- node-based containers
				- any std container other than std::vector, std::deque, std::string
		- argument passed in is different from the contained type
			- if object itself is passed then no temporary has to be created with insert
		- container is unlikely to reject new value
			- some containers reject if it's a duplicate (std::set for example)
		- object does not manage any resources
			- deferred construction makes emplace exception unsafe
			- exception between the creation of the resource and passing on of it to the managing object will leak
	- never less efficient than insertion counterpart
- one danger is bypassing explicit constructors
	- point of explicit constructors is to prevent implicit construction from this type
	- push_back will prevent implicit construction of temporary using argument
	- emplace_back will forward it to the explicit constructor
