## noexcept
- binary qualifier replacing C++98's exception specifications
- guarantee function won't throw exceptions
- just as important as const
- allows better optimizations
	- standard library copy constructors often use move_if_noexcept
		- for backwards compatibility, copy construction can't throw exceptions
		- use move semantics only if guarenteed noexcept
- conditional noexcept
	- whether they are noexcept depends on whether expr in noexcept(expr) is noexcept 
- exception neutral
	- most functions don't directly throw exceptions, but called functions may
	- let exceptions pass up 
- all memory deallocation and destructors are implicitly noexcept
- contract wideness may impact whether a function should be noexcept
	- wide contract means this function imposes no preconditions
		- easy to apply noexcept
	- narrow contract means defined behaviour only under preconditions
		- can either list as noexcept and document preconditions
			- caller's responsibility to adhere to preconditions
		- or leave out noexcept
