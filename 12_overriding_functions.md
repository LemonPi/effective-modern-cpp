## overriding functions
- overriding conditions
	- base class method is virtual
		- "virtual" keyword for derived methods are optional 
	- base and derived function names are identical
	- base and derived parameter types are identical
	- base and derived constness are identical
	- base and derived return types and exception specifications are **compatible**
	- base and derived reference qualifiers must be identical (C++11)
		- restricts usage to lvalues only or to rvalues only
		- void doWork()&;
			- only applies when *this is an lvalue
		- void doWork()&&;
			- only applies when *this is an rvalue
- apply "override" keyword to elicit compiler complaints on incorrectly overriding methods
	- only applies at the end of method declaration
	- contextual in that legacy code can have override as method name
		- backward compatibility reasons
