## scoped enums
- C++98 enum names belong to the scope containing the enum rather than the enum itself
	- need to make sure no conflicting names in surrounding scope
	- difficult to do in global scope
- scoped enums (enum class) keep names in enum scope
- are strongly typed
	- unscoped enums implicitly convert to integral type and from there to floating point
		- enum Color {black, white, red}; Color c = red; if (c < 14.5) {...} is valid
	- no implicit conversions to any other type
- can be forward declared
	- unscoped enums have their underlying type selected based on max value
		- compilers optimize for memory by choosing smallest type enclosing range
		- need to define all enuerators
	- scoped enum is always known and specifiable
		- enum class Status; uses int as the default underlying type
		- enum class Status : char; uses char as underlying type
	- scoped enums can also now specify underling type in the same way (but not default int underlying type)
	- defintion can be in a cpp file and changes won't necessarily affect all files including the declaration
